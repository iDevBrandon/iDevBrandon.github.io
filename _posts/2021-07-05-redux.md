# Let's master Redux

## Why we use Redux?
React data can flow only one way. By using Redux store, we don't need to pass down so many things through several levels. 

## 1.1 Create To-Do list with React-Redux

```
npx create-react-app todo-redux

yarn add redux react-redux

```

### 1.1.1 todos module

```JavaScript
const CHANGE_INPUT = 'todos/CHANGE_INPUT';



```
