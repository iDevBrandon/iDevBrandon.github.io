# Let's master Redux

## Why we use Redux?
React data can flow only one way. By using Redux store, we don't need to pass down so many things through several levels. Redux is used for immutable state management. 

## 3 important concept of Redux 
- Action 
- Store 
- Reducer 

### Action 
Action is like an event. They are the only way to send the data to Redux store. Actions are sent by using store.dispatch() method.  
Action is created by an action creator and has a type & payload as an extra data. 
```
{
    type: 'CREATE',
    payload: {
    	username: 'idevbrandon',
        password: 'hello123'
    }
}

```

### Reducer
Reducers are pure functions. It takes the current state of application and action and then return a new state. 
```
const Reducer  = (state, action) => {
	return state + 1; // return a updated state 
}
```

### store 
The store holds the application state.
```
import { createStore } from "redux";
const store = createStore(component)
```

## Project time - Create To-Do list with React-Redux

```

npx create-react-app todo-redux

yarn add redux react-redux


```

### 1.1.1 todos module

```JavaScript
const CHANGE_INPUT = 'todos/CHANGE_INPUT';


```



// Action -> Describe your status. ex) i'm hungry, but not the action of buying a burger. 

// Initial state & Reducer 

// Store -> Global state


// Apply to the component with connect()

```JavaScript
const makeContainer = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
makeContainer(target component)

```

How to visualize it 
```
 const store = createStore(
   reducer, /* preloadedState, */
+  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
 );

```
